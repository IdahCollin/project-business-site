## Business Site

First team project in our Technigo web developer boot camp. The task was to create a business one-pager website containing a image header and a signup form with main focus to practice HTML forms. Mob-programming format was used.

Team members on this project: Anna Robertsson, Inna Kokic, Jenny Larsen, Laura Lyckholm and Idah Collin.

## The problem

We started out by using Figjam and Figma to sketch a design. VScode with "Live share" was used to practice working as a team. We had a problem with the first push. This was solved by noticing that the terminal sent the information to the wrong repository. By adjusting the url this was solved.

If we've had more time we would work more on the design. We would also made the form require the check-in date to be before the check-out date.

After the team hand-in I continued working to make the code more clean, added some comments, changed the alignment and styling of the footer.
